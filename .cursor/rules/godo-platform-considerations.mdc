# Godo Platform-Specific Considerations

This project is cross-platform, but some features are only available or fully supported on certain operating systems. Please keep these considerations in mind:

## Global Hotkey Support
- Global hotkey capture is **only implemented for Windows**. On Linux/WSL2/macOS, this feature is not available and will log a warning. 
- Document this limitation in user-facing documentation and make the feature optional in the UI.

## System Tray Support
- System tray integration may not work on minimal Linux/WSL2 environments. The app should degrade gracefully and not fail if the tray is unavailable.

## Platform-Specific Tests
- Platform-specific features (e.g., hotkeys, tray) should be tested only on supported platforms. Use build tags and skip or mock these tests elsewhere.

## Repository Pattern and Dependency Injection
- For small, single-user apps, strict repository and DI patterns (e.g., Wire) may be relaxed. Use them only where they add value.

## Log Rotation and Rate Limiting
- Log rotation and API rate limiting are optional for local desktop use. Enable only if log size or abuse is a concern.

## Interface Segregation
- Use interfaces only where needed (e.g., for testing or plugin points). Avoid unnecessary indirection in a small codebase.

## Preferences API
- Fyne requires a unique app ID for preferences. Use `app.NewWithID()` or provide a `FyneApp.toml` with an `id` field.
