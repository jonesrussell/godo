# Project: Godo - A Todo Application with Quick-Note Support

## Important Notes on GUI library
- fyne.io/fyne/v2 v2.5.3
  1. Key.Modifier doesn't exist
  2. there is no RequestFocus() method

## Project Overview
- Todo application with two main features:
  1. Quick-note capture via global hotkey
  2. Full-featured todo management interface
- Built with Go and SQLite
- Uses Bubble Tea for TUI
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)

## Core Features
- Quick-Note System
  - Global hotkey registration
  - Minimal graphical popup window
    - Platform-specific implementations
    - Windows: Win32 API
    - macOS: Cocoa/NSWindow
    - Linux: GTK
  - Instant task capture
- Full UI Mode (Terminal-based)
  - Task organization
  - Task completion tracking
  - Task deletion
- Database
  - SQLite3 storage
  - Repository pattern
  - Service layer abstraction

## Technical Requirements
- Go 1.23.4 (as of March 2024 - Note: Earlier I incorrectly claimed Go 1.22 was latest)
- SQLite3
- MinGW-w64 GCC (for Windows)

## Code Style & Standards
- Follow standard Go formatting guidelines
- Implement dependency injection using Wire
- Use structured logging with Zap
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Project Structure
- cmd/godo/ - Main application entry point
- internal/
  - di/ - Dependency injection
  - logger/ - Logging system
  - service/ - Business logic
  - ui/ - User interface components
- pkg/ - Public libraries (if needed)

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all packages
  - Service tests
  - Repository tests
  - Database tests
  - Hotkey system tests
- Integration tests
- CI pipeline integration

## System Integration
- Graceful shutdown handling
- System service support
  - Windows service
  - Linux systemd
  - macOS launchd
- Auto-start capability
- Update mechanism

## Documentation
- Comprehensive README
- API documentation
- Usage examples
- Installation guides
- Hotkey documentation

## Future Considerations
- Task categories/tags
- Due dates and reminders
- Data export/import
- Task priorities
- Recurring tasks
- Multiple lists
- Cloud sync

Remember: Focus on reliability, user experience, and cross-platform compatibility while maintaining clean, maintainable code.
