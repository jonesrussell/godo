# Godo

A minimalist todo application with quick-note hotkey support.

## Overview

Godo combines two powerful features:
1. A global hotkey that triggers a lightweight graphical popup for instantly capturing thoughts and tasks
2. A terminal-based (TUI) interface for detailed todo management

The quick-note feature uses a minimal graphical window that appears when you press the hotkey - type your note, hit enter, and it disappears. The main todo management interface uses a terminal UI for efficient keyboard-driven task organization.
