# Project: Godo - A Todo Application with Quick-Note Support

## Project Overview
- Todo application with two main features:
  1. Quick-note capture via global hotkey
  2. Full-featured todo management interface
- Built with Go and SQLite
- Uses Bubble Tea for TUI
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)

## Technical Requirements
- Go 1.23+
- SQLite3
- MinGW-w64 GCC (for Windows)

## Code Style & Standards
- Follow standard Go formatting guidelines
- Implement dependency injection using Wire
- Use structured logging with Zap
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names
